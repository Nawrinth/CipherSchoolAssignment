Ques - 01: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a for loop.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, sum = 0;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    cout << "The sum of the first " << n << " natural numbers is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}

Ques-02: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and calculates the factorial of N using a loop.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    int factorial = 1;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        factorial *= i;
    }

    cout << "The factorial of " << n << " is: " << factorial << endl;

    return 0;
}

Ques-03: Write a C++ program that takes an integer N as input from the user and prints the multiplication table of N up to 10 using a loop.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        cout << n << " x " << i << " = " << n * i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
