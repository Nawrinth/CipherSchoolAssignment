Ques - 01 - Write a C++ program that takes two strings as input from the user and concatenates them. Then, output the concatenated string.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    string s1;
    string s2;
    cin >> s1;
    cin >> s2;
    string s3 = s1+s2;
    cout << s3;
    return 0;
}

Ques-02 -Write a C++ program that takes five grades (integers) as input from the user and calculates the average grade. Output the average grade to the user.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int grade[5];
    float avg;
    for(int i = 0;i<5;i++){
        cout << "Enter grade " << i+1 << " : ";
        cin >> grade[i];
    }
    for(int i = 0;i<5;i++)
        avg+=grade[i];
    cout <<"The average grade is : " << avg/5;


    return 0;
}

Ques-03 - Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input from the user and outputs its square.

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << "The square of " << n << " is : " << n*n;

    return 0;
}
